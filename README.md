# NPS-Dashboard
I have created a NPS Dashboard in Power BI

Dataset Explanation
The dataset contains Net Promoter Score (NPS) performance data across multiple service centers in Karnataka.
Columns include:
- Location & SC_code: Identifies each service center.
- Month: Time period of reporting.
- D1–D6, P7–P8, Pr9–Pr10: Categories of responses (Detractors, Passives, Promoters).
- Grand_Total: Total survey responses.
- Target_Promoter: Benchmark target for promoters.
- >1 HR cases, Within_1_hour, <=1 HR cases: Service resolution metrics.
KPIs
- NPS Score = %Promoters − %Detractors.
- Promoter Achievement = Actual promoters vs. Target promoters.
- Service Resolution Efficiency = % cases resolved within 1 hour.
- Monthly Trend Analysis = Tracking NPS and resolution across months.
- Location Performance = Comparing centers against targets.
Dashboard Purpose
- Provide management visibility into customer satisfaction and service efficiency.
- Identify high-performing centers and underperforming centers.
- Track monthly improvements or declines in NPS.
- Support decision-making for staff training, resource allocation, and audits.
